*Permalink | Share*

Edited on **September 9, 2025**, to announce that **registration is now open** and **new exam preparation resources** are available on **AWS Skill Builder**.

Registration is now open for the **AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate** exam (previously known as the **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate**) to align with the latest skills and knowledge in monitoring and maintaining Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. The last day to take the **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (SOA-C02)** exam will be **September 29, 2025**.

## From SysOps to CloudOps

We are renaming this certification to **AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate** to reflect the evolving nature of **cloud operations** and the change in **industry terminology**. This change aims to **enhance the relevance and credibility** of individuals who earn this certification, highlighting their **knowledge** and **skills** in deploying, operating, and maintaining workloads on AWS.

## From SOA-C02 to SOA-C03

We have updated the exam with the help of **subject matter experts (SMEs)** and will release a **new exam guide** on **September 9, 2025**. A key difference between **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate (SOA-C02)** and **AWS Certified CloudOps Engineer – Associate (SOA-C03)** is that **containers** are now in scope for **SOA-C03**.

We have included **more modern services and features**, increased emphasis on **multi-account, multi-Region architectures**, and more on **automation** and **infrastructure as code**. No task statements were removed between exam versions, but the **new content outline is more detailed** with some reorganization of the task statements.
