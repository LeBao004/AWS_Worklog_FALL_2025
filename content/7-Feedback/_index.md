### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.

### Additional Questions
- What were you most **satisfied** with during your internship?
> "What I was most satisfied with was the Mentor's guidance method. Instead of 'holding your hand', the Mentor always encouraged me to think for myself, research and test solutions first. This not only helped me remember things longer but also trained me in problem-solving thinking - an important skill that schools rarely provide opportunities to practice."

- What do you think the company **needs to improve** for future interns?
> "Based on my personal experience, I think the company should organize more regular Team Bonding or Happy Hour activities. Although everyone is very friendly, sometimes the work schedule limits personal interaction. These sessions will help members (especially new members) better understand each other's personalities and working styles, thereby helping them to work together more effectively."

- If you were to introduce this to a friend, would you **recommend them to intern here**? Why?
> "Definitely YES. This is an ideal environment for those who want to 'practice'. Here, interns not only do auxiliary work but also directly participate in the actual project process, have access to new technology and are respected as an official employee. The balance between work pressure and dedicated support is the biggest plus point."

### Suggestions & wishes
- What suggestions do you have to improve the internship experience?

> About expertise: "I suggest that the team can organize more short internal Tech Sharing sessions (about 30 minutes - 1 hour) every week or every 2 weeks, where everyone shares about a new technology or a difficult case study that has just been solved. Interns can also participate in presentations to hone their skills."

- Do you want to continue this program in the future?
> "I really hope to continue working with FCJ and develop to higher positions (such as Collaborator or official employee) after finishing the internship. I feel that the company's culture and orientation are very suitable for my career development path."
- Other comments:
> "I would like to send my sincere thanks to the Mentors who have always patiently supported me throughout the past time. Thank you FCJ for giving me a truly meaningful and complete 'First Cloud Journey' as the name of the program."
